# My dotfiles

## Installation

Dotfiles are installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal, just copy one of the following commands and execute in the terminal:

Tell Git who you are using these commands:

```sh
git config -f ~/.gitlocal user.email "email@yoursite.com"
git config -f ~/.gitlocal user.name "Name Lastname"
```

Clone dotfiles repo:

```sh
# Clone dotfiles repo
git clone https://github.com/AMSHL/dots.git $HOME/.dotfiles

# Go to the dotfiles directory
cd $HOME/.dotfiles

# Install dotfiles
./install
```

## Updating

Use single command to get latest updates:

```
update
```

This command will update dotfiles, their dependencies, `brew` or `apt-get` packages, global `npm` dependencies, `gem`s, `apm` plugins.

## Under the hood

> **Note:** You may put your custom settings into `~/.zshlocal`.

### Projects tree

I suggest you to organize project folder as follows:

```
~/Projects
├── Forks       # for GitHub fork
├── Job         # for job projects
├── Playground  # for short-term experiments
└── Repos       # for long-term projects
```
